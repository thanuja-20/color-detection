**COLOR-DETECTION**
Color detection is a crucial process in image processing and computer vision, aiming to identify and extract specific colors or color ranges from images or videos. The process typically involves the following steps:

**Image Acquisition:** Acquiring an image or video frame containing the object or scene of interest.

**Color Space Conversion:** Converting the image to a different color space, such as HSV or LAB, to better represent color information.

**Color Filtering:** Retaining pixels within the defined color ranges while filtering out others. This step may involve morphological operations to refine detected regions.

**Object Detection/Segmentation:** Further processing to detect or segment objects based on their color. Techniques like contour detection or connected component labeling may be employed.

**Post-processing:** Applying additional steps to refine detected regions, remove noise, or extract features for further analysis or visualization.

Color detection finds applications across various domains, including object tracking and recognition, robotics, medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and augmented reality. It enables the extraction of valuable information from visual data based on color characteristics, facilitating tasks in image processing, computer vision, and related fields.
